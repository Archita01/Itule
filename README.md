Make your Mental Health a Priority.

# Problem Statement
A lot of students, professionals, and individuals in general struggle to find a perfect balance between their work and personal life.
- Students often feel pressured to perform well in exams, this pressure often causes them to forget to take out time for themselves which might lead to mental exhaustion.
- Due to the covid situation around 71% of corporate jobs have switched to work from home. However, a major disadvantage that arises from this is that employees find it difficult to have a good balance between their work and personal life.

# Solution
To reduce this all we came up with "ITULE". With Itule we provide an approximate value that will help an individual gauge how good/bad an their work-life balance is. 

# Why ITULE ?
Our app helps you organise your private & professional life. It includes a schedule tracker that prompts the user to fill out an elaborate questionnaire and returns Work-Life Balance Score. It indicates how you thrive in both your professional and personal lives: it reflects how well you shape your lifestyle, habits, and behaviours to maximize your overall life satisfaction. 

> The Work-Life Balance Score is divided as follows: a poor score is below 550, a good score is above 680, an excellent score is above 700.

# Future Perspective
## 1. Connecting with Therapist-
We plan to introduce a virtual platform for users to connect with free or paid therapy services.

## 2. Build it further for a Company-
The app can be further built to provide statistics using a pie graph etc. to understand the overall work-life balance of employees in a company or students in college/schools.

## 3. Personalised Schedule-
We intend to improve upon the app by making a personalized schedule based on an individual's work-life balance score.
