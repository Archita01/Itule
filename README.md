Make your Mental Health a Priority.

# Problem Statement
A lot of students, professionals, and individuals in general struggle to find a perfect balance between their work and personal life.
- Students often feel pressured to perform well in exams, this pressure often causes them to forget to take out time for themselves which might lead to mental exhaustion.
- Due to the covid situation around 71% of corporate jobs have switched to work from home. However, a major disadvantage that arises from this is that employees find it difficult to have a good balance between their work and personal life.


A report suggests that more than 43 million people struggle with mental illness. One of the hardest things for an individual is realizing that they do not have a good balance between their work and personal life. Especially healthcare professionals had to work 24/7, even during pandemic, which created havoc in their lives. 


# Solution
To reduce this all we came up with "ITULE". With Itule we provide an approximate value that will help an individual gauge how good/bad an their work-life balance is. We want people to identify that they should let go a little and live life. After all, creating a healthy mindset is an investment in your overall being. 

# Why ITULE ?
Our app helps you organise your private & professional life. It includes a schedule tracker that prompts the user to fill out an elaborate questionnaire and returns Work-Life Balance Score. It indicates how you thrive in both your professional and personal lives: it reflects how well you shape your lifestyle, habits, and behaviours to maximize your overall life satisfaction. 

> The Work-Life Balance Score is divided as follows: a poor score is below 550, a good score is above 680, an excellent score is above 700.

# Future Perspective
## 1._Connecting with Therapist-_
We plan to introduce a virtual platform for users to connect with free or paid therapy services.

## 2. _Build it further for a Company-_
The app can be further built to provide statistics using a pie graph etc. to understand the overall work-life balance of employees in a company or students in college/schools.

## 3. _Personalised Schedule-_
We intend to improve upon the app by making a personalized schedule based on an individual's work-life balance score.

## 4._Professional Use in Healthcare Industry-_
We intend to improve our app such that it can be used by health care professionals in hospitals or clinics to judge their work-life balance in order to get a better perspective about the patient's mental health.
